## 3. Summary of Modifications and Added Features

The following primary architectural enhancements and features were introduced in this fork:

1. **Apple-Grade Automix & Advanced Multiband Crossfade Engine (`crates/music/src/transition.rs`):**
   - Implemented high-performance DSP transition engine with silence trimming, onset cushioning, and multiband crossover filtering.
   - Dual-deck overlapping playback system (`crates/music/src/spotify/playback.rs` and `crates/music/src/spotify/sink.rs`) supporting seamless intro/outro mixing.
   - Dynamic Biquad high-pass filter frequency sweeps and vocal-morph curves.
   - Configurable modes: AutoMix, Auto Crossfade, and Manual Crossfade with customizable duration.

2. **Curated Home Screen & Poly UI Overhaul:**
   - Added curated music recommendations and section layouts (`crates/views/src/screens/home/curated.rs`, `crates/views/src/screens/home/mod.rs`).
   - Integrated custom SVG icon pack (`poly-logo.svg`, `flame.svg`, `sparkles.svg`, `trending-up.svg`, `trophy.svg`, `mic-2.svg`, `bookmark.svg`, `more-horizontal.svg`).
   - Replaced default title bar with floating, scroll-following rounded window controls with transparent background.
   - Redesigned acrylic glassmorphic player control bar with gradient fades and border refinements.
   - Streamlined sidebar navigation matching Poly ecosystem specifications.

3. **High-Resolution Artwork Loader:**
   - Overhauled album and artist thumbnail resolution pipeline across Spotify and provider modules to fetch uncompressed/maximum-resolution cover art instead of low-resolution thumbnails.

4. **Hierarchical Lyrics Provider Algorithm & Smooth Pop Animations:**
   - Implemented multi-tier lyrics selection ranking: Word-by-word synced (TTML) > Sentence-by-sentence synced (LRC) > Unsynced lyrics.
   - Smooth pop-in and pop-out animations for lyrics drawer transitions with fluid page resizing.

5. **AMLL-Inspired Ambient Fullscreen Display:**
   - Low-overhead GPU ambient canvas featuring floating neon color blobs synchronized with album artwork palettes.

6. **Looping & Infinite Smart Autoplay:**
   - Enhanced repeat modes (single song repeat, playlist loop) and infinite style playback continuation.

7. **Windows Fast Build Tooling:**
   - Added `build-fast.bat` for optimized incremental developer compilation.
